        <h3>Waterloop Design Team</h3>
        <p>As a mechanical and HV team member, I contributed to the drivetrain and battery systems of our team's Hyperloop vehicle. We made a custom battery pack, onto which I installed a Daly passive balancer/monitor and a Daly active balancer. </p>

        <H3>Fatherless Catch Baseball Machine</h3>

        <p>For the ME 100 toy design project, our group set out to prototype a machine that could play a game of catch with the user. The Fatherless Catch first receives a thrown ball by catching it with the net, funnelling the ball to a holder, and letting loose of a spring-driven arm that scoops up the ball and snaps forward, throwing the ball. The drivetrain consists of an AC/DC converter transforming 120V AC outlet potential into 12V DC with a maximum current of 10 amps. When switched on, it supplies the full 120W to the stepper motor which, along with a 4:1 bike chain gear reduction cranks the catapult back with an estimated torque of 16.3 N*m. I was responsible for soldering the drivetrain circuitry and helping to develop the chain gear reduction, frame, and mechanical joints in the machine.</p>
